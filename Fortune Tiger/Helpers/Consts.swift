        "Amur tiger": """
        The Amur tiger, also known as the Siberian tiger, is the largest of all tiger subspecies. Its range includes the far eastern regions of Russia, including the Primorsky and Khabarovsk territories. Amur tigers are known for their thick fur, which helps them survive in harsh winter conditions. They hunt large ungulates such as deer and wild boar. Unfortunately, the number of Amur tigers has significantly decreased due to poaching and habitat loss. Today, active measures are being taken to protect and restore their population.
        """,
        "Bengal Tiger": """
        The Bengal tiger, found in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan, is one of the most well-known tiger subspecies. It is distinguished by its bright orange coat with black stripes and white markings. Bengal tigers prefer dense forests and mangrove swamps, where they hunt a variety of prey, including deer, buffalo, and wild boar. Currently, Bengal tigers are under threat due to poaching and habitat loss. However, thanks to conservation efforts, their numbers are gradually recovering.
        """,
        "Chinese Tiger": """
        The Chinese tiger, also known as the South China tiger, is one of the rarest and least studied subspecies. Its range once extended across southern China, but now the number of these tigers in the wild is extremely low. Chinese tigers are smaller in size compared to other subspecies and have a lighter coat. They prefer forested and mountainous areas. Efforts are currently being made to conserve and breed Chinese tigers in captivity with the goal of reintroducing them into the wild.
        """,
        "Indochina Tiger": """
        The Indochinese tiger inhabits forests and mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. This subspecies is smaller and darker compared to the Bengal tiger. Indochinese tigers hunt a variety of animals, including deer, wild boar, and small mammals. They are under threat due to habitat loss and poaching. Active efforts are currently underway to protect and restore their population.
